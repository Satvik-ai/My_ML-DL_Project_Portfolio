| ðŸš€ Project | ðŸ“„ Description |
------------- | -------------
[Plant Disease Classification](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/Plant-Disease-Classification) | 	Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect plant diseases from leaf images, helping to automate agricultural diagnostics.
[Taxi Fare Guru : Total Amount Prediction](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/Taxi-Fare-Guru-Total-Amount-Prediction) | Used regression models to predict taxi fare amounts using features like trip distance, pickup time, and location data.
[CNN for CIFAR-10 Classification Using PyTorch](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/CNN_for_CIFAR10_Classification_Using_PyTorch) | 	Implemented a CNN in PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories such as airplanes, cats, and trucks.
[FNN for Digits Classification Using PyTorch](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/FNN_for_Digits_Classification_Using_PyTorch) | 	Built a simple feedforward neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.
[FNN for Iris Classification Using PyTorch](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/FNN_for_Iris_Classification_Using_PyTorch) | Created a basic feedforward neural net for multiclass classification of the classic Iris dataset, showcasing PyTorch fundamentals.
[Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Classification Using PyTorch](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/Logistic_Regression_For_Breast_Cancer_Classification_Using_PyTorch) | Implemented logistic regression from scratch in PyTorch to classify tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
